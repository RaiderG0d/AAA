    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be computationally expensive, data-intensive, and prone to stability issues during training. However, advancements in algorithms, hardware, and techniques (e.g., distributed RL, transfer learning) continually improve its practicality and effectiveness. Thus, Deep RL is a powerful framework for solving problems where explicit programming or rule-based approaches fall short, making it a cornerstone of modern AI research and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a framework for **Deep RL using JAX**, a library for array-oriented computation, with automatic differentiation and JIT compilation to enable high-performance machine learning research.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to run this notebook, make sure that you have installed the following packages:\n",
    "* jax (you probably installed it previously in TP6)\n",

    "* gymnax\n",
    "* flax\n",
    "* distrax\n",

    "If some of these packages are missing, you can install them the usual way. For instance, if you need to install `gymnax`, then\n",

    "### 2. Deep Q Network\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1. Why do we need deep reinforcement learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, Q-learning is an **off-policy** algorithm (the target policy is not the policy used for decision-making) that maintains and updates a Q-table, an explicit mapping of states to corresponding action values.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Q-learning is a practical solution for environments with discrete action spaces and restricted observation spaces, it struggles to scale well to more complex environments. Indeed, creating a Q-table requires **defining\n",
    "the action and observation spaces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example of autonomous driving, the observation space is composed of an infinity of potential configurations derived from camera feeds and other sensory inputs. On the other hand, the action space\n",
    "includes a wide spectrum of steering wheel positions and varying levels of force applied to the brake and accelerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we could theoretically discretize the observation and action spaces, the sheer volume of possible states and actions leads to an **impractical Q-table** in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding optimal actions in large and complex state-action spaces thus requires **powerful function approximation algorithms**, which is precisely what Neural Networks are. In the case of Deep Reinforcement Learning, neural nets are used as a replacement for the Q-table and provide an efficient solution to the curse of dimensionality introduced by large state spaces. Furthermore, we do not need to define the observation space explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) combines the strengths of deep learning and reinforcement learning**, enabling agents to learn complex behaviors and decision-making in environments with high-dimensional state and action spaces. Here's why Deep RL is valuable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling High-Dimensional Inputs:** Traditional RL struggles with raw, unprocessed inputs like images or sensor data. Deep RL leverages deep neural networks to extract meaningful features from such inputs, making it effective for tasks like robotics, video games, and autonomous driving.\n",
    "2. **Learning Complex Policies:** Deep RL can learn sophisticated policies and strategies directly from data, even in environments with complex dynamics, sparse rewards, or long-term dependencies.\n",
    "3. **Generalization Across Tasks:** By using deep networks, agents can generalize better to unseen states or variations within the environment, allowing them to adapt to slightly different but related scenarios.\n",
    "4. **Scalability:** Deep RL scales well with modern computational resources and architectures, enabling the training of agents in expansive, continuous, or multi-agent environments.\n",
    "5. **Exploration and Adaptation:** Deep RL agents can explore their environment and adapt their behavior over time, making it suitable for dynamic and uncertain real-world problems.\n",
    "6. **End-to-End Learning:** Deep RL often requires minimal manual feature engineering, as neural networks learn the necessary representations directly from data, simplifying the workflow."

    "#### 2.2. Deep Q-networks (DQN)\n",
    "\n",
    "DQN uses two types of neural networks in parallel, starting with the \"online\" network, which is used for **Q-value prediction** and **decision-making**. On the other hand, the \"target\" network is used to **create stable Q-targets** to assess the performance of the online net via the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to Q-learning, DQN agents are defined by two functions: `act` and `update`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.1. Act\n",
    "\n",
    "The `act` function implements an epsilon-greedy policy with respect to Q-values, which are estimated by the online neural network. In other words, the agent selects the action corresponding to the **maximum predicted Q-value** for a given state, with a set probability of acting randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might remember that Q-learning updates its Q-table **after every step**. However, in Deep Learning, it is common practice to compute updates using **gradient descent on a batch of inputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, DQN stores experiences (tuples containing `state`, `action`, `reward`, `next_state`, `done_flag`) in a **replay buffer**. Instead of using only the last experience, we sample a batch of experiences from this buffer to train the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"DQN_action_selection.PNG\" alt='DQN_action_selection.PNG' width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.2. Update\n",
    "\n",
    "The `update` function is responsible for training the network. It computes a **mean squared error** (MSE) loss based on the **temporal-difference** (TD) error:\n",
    "$$L(\\theta)=E\\left[ (r+(1-done) \\times \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a';\\theta^-) - Q(s,a;\\theta))^2 \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this loss function, $\\theta$ denotes the **parameters of the online network**, and $\\theta^-$ represents the **parameters of the target network**. The parameters of the target network are set on the online network's parameters every $N$ steps, similar to a *checkpoint* ($N$ is a hyperparameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation of parameters (with $\\theta$ for the current Q-values and $\\theta^-$ for the target (Q-values)) is crucial to stabilize training. Using the same parameters for both would be similar to aiming at a moving target, as updates to the network would immediately shift the target values. By **periodically updating** $\\theta^-$ (i.e., freezing these parameters for a set number of steps), we ensure **stable Q-targets** while the online network continues to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the $(1-done)$ term **adjusts the target for terminal states**. Indeed, when an episode ends (i.e., \"done\" is equal to 1), there is no next state. Therefore, the Q-value for the next state is set to 0.\n",

    "* **Diversity:** As the sampling is not limited to recent experiences, we generally observe a lower variance in updates and prevent overfitting to the latest experiences.\n",

The `+1` comes from the fact that we also evaluate the initial policy per default. You can change the parameter `skip_initial_evaluation` in the initial CONFIG to skip the initial policy. Beware that smaller values of `eval_freq` will produce episodic return plots with much noise."
